# Infrastructure

The term "infrastructure" refers to [mission](../messaging/stakeholders/organization-management.md#mission)-agnostic supporting structures and processes that enable more mission-specific activities and value generation on top of them.

## Engineering

Examples here include things like highly-available infrastructure, automated testing, and other technical concerns - all of which tends to fall under the responsibility of [engineering management](../messaging/stakeholders/engineering-management.md).
