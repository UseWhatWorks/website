# The Use What Works Manifesto

> We are a group of practitioners who believe in choosing proven solutions over building bespoke frameworks.

## Our Principles

**1. Stand on the shoulders of giants**

Before writing custom code, look for battle-tested libraries and frameworks that solve your problem. Thousands of hours of development, testing, and real-world usage have gone into open source solutions. Respect that investment.

**2. Your business logic is unique; your infrastructure is not**

Focus your custom code on what makes your product different. Authentication, routing, state management, and data fetching have been solved. Use those solutions.

**3. Maintenance is a feature**

Every line of code you write is a line you must maintain. Libraries maintained by active communities share that burden across thousands of developers.

**4. NIH syndrome is expensive**

"Not Invented Here" costs more than pride. It costs time, money, and opportunity. The best engineers know when to build and when to integrate.

**5. Boring technology is a compliment**

Proven, stable, "boring" tools let you ship faster and sleep better. Save innovation for where it creates customer value.

**6. Documentation matters**

Well-documented solutions accelerate onboarding and reduce tribal knowledge. Popular libraries come with tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and community support.

**7. Evaluate, then commit**

Take time to choose the right tool. Once chosen, commit fully. Constant second-guessing and premature optimization waste more time than careful initial selection.

## What This Means in Practice

- Use React, Vue, or Svelte instead of building a custom reactive framework
- Use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB instead of building a custom database
- Use Auth0, Clerk, or Supabase Auth instead of rolling your own authentication
- Use Stripe or PayPal instead of building payment processing
- Use established CSS frameworks or design systems instead of starting from scratch
- Use proven testing frameworks instead of custom test harnesses
