# The Use What Works Manifesto

> We are a group of practitioners who believe in choosing proven solutions over building bespoke frameworks.

## Our Principles

**1. Stand on the shoulders of giants**

Before writing custom code, look for battle-tested libraries and frameworks that solve your problem. Thousands of hours of development, testing, and real-world usage have gone into open source solutions. Respect that investment.
