# Engineering management

This is group of people having "people management" responsibilities over the engineering function in an organization.

## Responsibilities

* Fostering an environment with systems and processes that allow for a continued flow of sustainable work even as people come and go from the organization. This serves the overall need to [manage risk](/messaging/stakeholders/organization-management.md#managing-risk).

## The Case for "Use What Works": Why Tech Leaders Don't Reinvent the Wheel

Many leaders believe their problems are unique, their scale unprecedented, their requirements so specific that only a custom-built solution can work.
This mindset will cost you more than any technology ever will.

### The Hidden Cost of "Rolling Your Own"

Every custom solution your team builds is one they must maintain. Either forever, or until someone finally removes it, often years after the original developer has left. This leaves behind a legacy no one fully understands, and everyone is afraid to touch.
If you have spent any time in technology leadership, you have inherited one of these systems. You know the feeling: the documentation is sparse, the original author is unreachable, and the thing is somehow load-bearing for your entire operation.
Ask yourself honestly: how much of your engineering budget goes toward maintaining problems that someone else has already solved?

### The "Use What Works" Philosophy

The Use What Works manifesto offers a direct principle: organizations should use existing, proven, and sustainable solutions to common problems rather than developing and maintaining their own.
This philosophy emerges from recognizing where your organization's differentiation actually lies.
Your authentication system is probably not your competitive advantage. Neither is your deployment pipeline, your logging setup, or your database management tooling. These are solved problems. Teams whose entire focus is on solving them have solved them well.

### Five Reasons This Matters for Your Business

1. **Your Best Engineers Should Be Building Your Product**
Every hour a talented developer spends building a custom caching layer is an hour not spent on features that differentiate your product. Proven solutions let your team focus on value creation instead of infrastructure reinvention.

2.** Turnover Is Inevitable. Plan for It.**
People leave. When they do, who maintains the custom solution they built? If documented, it reflects their style, assumptions, and understanding. Established technologies come with community knowledge, third-party documentation, and a hiring pool of people who already know how they work.d Beats Theoretically Elegant
3. **"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." - Linus' Law**
Software deployed across thousands of organizations and at every imaginable scale has already encountered — and resolved — problems your custom solution hasn’t even discovered yet. You benefit from the collective experience of an entire community.
4. **Predictability Reduces Risk**
Proven solutions come with documentation, case studies, and communities. When something breaks at 2 AM, there is likely a Stack Overflow thread, a support agreement, or a consultant who has seen it before. Your custom solution has none of these. Just an on-call engineer reading code they did not write.

### The Sustainability Argument

A broader consideration is at play here. Maintaining quality software costs money. When organizations cluster around proven solutions, maintenance costs are distributed across everyone who benefits. This creates sustainable systems that let even smaller organizations access enterprise-grade infrastructure.

The alternative, where everyone builds their own, fragments effort, duplicates cost, and delivers worse outcomes.

### When Custom Makes Sense
This is not absolutism. Legitimate cases exist for building custom solutions: when your requirements are unique, when existing options do not meet your needs, or when the problem is central to your business and you need complete control.
But those cases are rarer than most technology organizations believe. The only honest question worth asking: should we build this ourselves?

### The Bottom Line
Stop waste. Reduce risk. Focus your engineering talent on the problems that actually differentiate your business.
Use what works.
