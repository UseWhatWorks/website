# Career development

It can be good to build something from scratch as a way to learn the underlying concepts.

However, there's generally more value to a developer's career in knowing how to use already established technologies than there is in what they'd learn from building their own version of those things.

There's also the difficulty of convincing their next company to adopt what they built, because without that, and a commitment to allowing them to continue working on it, the knowledge they gained would grow stale pretty quickly.
